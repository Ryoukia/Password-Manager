#PASSWORD MANAGER
##Neat but insecure password manager created by Colin Lessor. Converts passwords into SHA256 hashes and stores them in a pickle for portability

<h3>I have always mistrusted password managers, even knowing that most security experts recommend that you use one, so I built one for myself to better understand the principles behind them. I am happy to report that I learned what makes them so advisable and would use one myself.</h3>
<h3>I will state here again that this password manager is most likely not secure, and could be breached, so I don't recommend downloading this and using it.</h3>
<h3>If you still want to try it out though, you have to initialize a passwordmanager object with parameter password, which is a string which will serve as the access code to the entire password manager.  Use the set function with parameters
  Use the get function to access a password based on its associated domain name.</h3>
